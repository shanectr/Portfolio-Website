      Hi, my name is Shane Ross and I am an aspiring front-end webdeveloper. I
      currently attend The University of Michigan as a 5th year senior earning a
      bachelors of general studies with a focus in front-end webdevelopment. I
      enjoy running and gaming to pass time, as well as working on personal
      projects to further my knowledge in front-end languages.

          I was on the University of Michigan Varsity Track and Field team from
          2020 to 2022. I was a 400 meter hurdler who competed at the top level
          during my high school and college track career.

          I will be graduating from The University of Michigan in May of 2025

          I have spent multiple years studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
          created numerous projects, both beginners and advanced, to further my
          knowledge of the subject. This was a change of course from my original
          track of computer science as a whole, but has taught me many lessons
          that I can bring to the job field.
